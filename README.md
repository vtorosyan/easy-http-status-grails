# Easy HttpStatus

The application is written with Groovy on Grails to demonstrate the concept of Easy HttpStatus. More lightweight approach is available [here](https://github.com/vtorosyan/easy-http-status)

Easy HttpStatus is designated to make choosing an HTTP status for RESTfull services easy. By answering to simple questions with Yes or No it gives you the status code with a short description which can/should be used.
